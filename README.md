 Master's Thesis (1st year): Mathematical Modelling of High-Frequency Data

## Motivation
Our goal is to study estimations of a volatility coefficient $\sigma$ to determine statistical procedures to test whether the trajectory of a process $X$ representing financial data over $[0,T]$ can be described by a Brownian diffusion in increasingly complex models. 

In the first section, we review some fundamental stochastic calculus results that will be used in the remainder of the paper.
In the second section, we define the general parametric framework of the paper.
In the third section, we study the problem in a particular and idealistic case where $\sigma$ is constant, providing a complete statistical procedure for this framework.
In the fourth section, we extend our model to the case where $\sigma$ is a deterministic function dependent on time or a stochastic process. We also give a complete statistical procedure for this new framework when $\sigma$ is deterministic. Within the time-dependent framework, we derive estimators and Central Limit Theorems for both integrated and spot-volatility.
